BIOS
The CPU doesn't magically or otherwise automatically know how to talk with any device; it needs some sort of support prrogramming loaded into memory that teaches it about a particular device. This prorgramming is called basic input/output services (BIOS). The programs dedicated to enabling the CPU to communicate with devices are called services (or device drivers, as you'll see later in the chapter). This goes well beyond the keyboard, by the way. In fact, every device on the computer needs BIOS! But let's continue with the keyboard for now.
Bringing BIOS to the PC
A talented programmer could write BIOS for a keyboard if the programmer knew the keyboard's codebook; keyboard are prettty simple devices. This begs the question: Where would this support programming be stored? Programming could be incorporated into the operating system. Storing programming to talk to the hardware of your PC in the operating system is great--all operating systems have built-in code that knows how to talk to your keyboard, your mouse, and just about every piece of hardware you may put into your PC.
That's fine once the operating system's up and running, but what about a brand-new stack of parts you're about to assemble into a new PC? When a new system is being built, it has no operating system. The CPU must have access to BIOS for the most important hardware on your PC: not only the keyboard, but also the monitor, mass storage drives, optical drives, USB ports, and RAM. This code can't be stored on a hard drive or optical disc--these important devices need to be ready at any time the CPU calls them, even before instaling a mass storage device or an operating system.
The perfect place to store the support programming is on the motherboard. That settles one issue, but another looms: What storage medium should the motherboard use? DRAM won't work, because all of the data would be erased every time you turned off the computer. You need some type of permanent program storage device that does not depend on other peripherals to work. And you need that storage device to sit on the motherboard.
ROM
Motherboards store the keyboard controller support programming, among other programs, on a special type of device called a read-only memory (ROM) chip. A ROM chip stores programs, services, exactly like RAM. ROM differs from RAM in two important ways. First, ROM chips are nonvolatile, meaning that the information stored on ROM isn't erased when the computer is turned off. Second, traditional ROM chips are read-only, meaning that once you store a program on one, you can't change it. Motherboards use a type of ROM called flash ROM, the same stuff that stores your data in your smartphone or SSD. That is why we call updating the BIOS firmware. "flashing the BIOS", which we will cover later in this chapter.
Every motherboard has a flash ROM chip, called the system ROM chip because it contains code that enables your CPU to talk to the basic hardware of your PC. As alluded to earlier, the system ROM holds BIOS for more than just the keyboard controller. It also stores programs for communicating with hard drives, optical drives, display devices, USB ports, and other basic devices on your motherboard.
