EXAM TIP
The CompTIA A+ 1001 objectives refer to microATX oddly as mATX. Don't be thrown off by the letter m. It just means micro here.
In 1999, Intel created a variant of the microATX called the FlexATX. FlexATX motherboards have maximum dimensions of just 9 by 7.5 inches, which makes them the smallest motherboards in the ATX standard. FlexATX is pretty much gone now.
ITX
VIA Technologies started the process to create a small form factor (SFF) motherboard, the ITX. The ITX itself wasn't a success, but VIA in turn created smaller form factors that today populate the SFF market, specifically Mini-ITX.
Mini-ITX is a miniscule 6.7 by 6.7 inches and compares head to head with the virtually identical micro ATX.
One of the great benefits of these SFF motherboards is the tiny amount of power needed to support them. ITX power supplies are quite small compared to a typical power supply. Lower power usage produces less heat, thus enabling passive cooling on many SFF systems. The lack of fan noise makes them ideal for media center PCs.
EXAM TIP
CompTIA lists ITX as a motherboard form factor. Straight ITX doesn't exist in the real world, but Mini-ITX is quite common. The CompTIA A+ 1001 objectives also refer to Mini-ITX as mITX.
Proprietary Form Factors
Several major PC makers in the past made motherboards that worked only with their cases. These proprietary motherboards enabled these companies to create systems that stood out from the generic ones and, not coincidentally pushed you to get service and upgrades from their authorized dealers. Some of the features you'll see in proprietary systems are riser cards--part of a motherboard separate from the main one but connected by a cable of some sort--and unique power connections. Riser cards on some proprietary systems plug into a unique socket or slot on the motherboard. These are also called daughter boards. Proprietary motherboards used to be common on full-sized systems; these days you'll see them in niche systems, like very small cubes and such.
*Try This!* Motherboard varieties
Motherboards come in a wide variety of form factors. Go to your local computer store and check out what is on display. Note the different features offered by ATX, microATX, and Mini-ITX motherboards.
1. ATX is common, but does the store stock Mini-ITX or proprietary motherboards?
2. Did the clerk use tech slang and call the motherboards "mobos"? (It's what most of us call them outside of formal textbooks, after all!)
Chipset
Every motherboard has a chipset, which is one or more discrete integrated circuit chips that support the CPU's interfacing to all the other devices on the motherboard. The chipset determines the type of processor the motherboard accepts, the type and capacity of RAM, and the sort of internal and external devices that the motherboard supports. Chipsets vary in features, performance, and stability, so they factor hugely in the purchase or recommendation of a particular motherboard. Good techs know their chipsets!
Because the chipset facilitates communication between the CPU and other devices in the system, its component chips are relatively centrally located on the motherboard. "Firmware" chipsets were originally composed of two primary chips: the northbridge and the southbridge.
The northbridge chip handled RAM, while the southbridge handled some expansion devices and mass storage drives, such as hard drives. Some motherboard manufacturers added (or still add) a third chip called the Super I/O chip to handle these chores, especially in dealing with legacy devices.
Today, other chips have absorbed many of the functions of the classic chipset. The CPU handles the memory controller features the northbridge used to do. The primary expansion bus communication (see "Expansion Bus" later in this chapter) goes through the CPU as well, something the southbridge handled back in the day. Most techs refer to the remaining support chips on the motherboard as the chipset, although the terms northbridge and southbridge are dead.
The system ROM chip provides part of the BIOS for the chipset, but only at a barebones, generic level. The chipset still needs support for the rest of the things it can do. So how do expansion devices get BIOS? From software drivers, of course, and the same holds true for modern chipsets. You have to load the proper drivers for the specific OS to support all of the features of today's chipsets. Without software drivers, you'll never create a stable, fully functional PC. Most motherboards ship with an optical disc with drivers, support programs, and extra-special goodies such as antivirus software.
Different chipsets offer support for a lot of different hardware options, including type of memory slot (DDR3 or DDR4), number and version of USB ports, various mass storage devices, integrated network connections, video support, and so on. Details below list typical chipset chores for an Intel Z390 chipset.

Good techs need to know the hot chipsets in detail. The chipset defines almost every motherboard features short of the CPU itself. Techs love to discuss chipsets and expect a fellow tech to know the differences between one chipset and another. You also need to be able to recommend a motherboard that suits a client's needs. In future topic "Building a PC", covers choosing components and building PCs for specific purposes, such as video editing and gaming. One of the most important choices you'll make in building a custom rig is selecting a chipset.
Standard Components
Every motherboard provides a socket (or two) for a CPU and slots for RAM. I already covered the variety of both sockets and slot types, so I won't rehash them here. You'll also find ports support standard mass storage devices, such as hard drives and solid-state drives.
Additional Components
The connections and capabilities of a motherboard sometimes differ from those of chipset the motherboard uses. This disparity happens for a couple of reasons. First, a particular chipset may support eight USB ports, but to keep costs down, the manufacturer might include only four ports. Second, a motherboard maker may choose to install extra features--ones not to supported by the chipset--by adding additional chips. A common example is a motherboard that supports an old serial port. Other technologies you might find are built-in sound, hard drive RAID controllers, network cards, and more. Some motherboards have added convenience features, such as case fan power connectors and running lights so you can see what you're working on.
USB
All chipsets support USB, but it seems no two motherboards offer the same port arrangement. My motherboard supports eight USB ports, for example, but if you look on the back of the motherboard, you'll only see four USB ports.
Most motherboards have sockets--internal USB connectors--to plug in dongles for additional external ports. These dongle connectors are standardized, so many cases have built-in front USB ports that have dongles attached. This is very handy for USB devices you might want to plug and unplug frequently, such as thumb drives or digital cameras.
Sound
Most motherboards come with onboard sound support. As with USB, a lot of motherboards have a port for connecting to audio jacks on the front of the case, another example (like USB) of front panel connectors. These enable you to plug headphones or microphones into the front rather than the rear of the case, a very convenient feature. These connectors are identical to the ones used on sound cards.
Networking
Most desktop motherboards come with one RJ-45 jack for attaching a network cable. The networking support is built into the chipset or come as an additional chip soldered to the motherboard. In futre topic "Essentials of Networking" will covers the physical aspects of networking in detail.
Video
Many motherboards sport one or more video ports for attaching a display. These vary a lot, from the older VGA ports to newer HDMI ports. In future topic "Display Technologies" will discuss video in depth, so we'll save further discussion until then.
RAID
RAID stands for redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks and is very common on motherboards. There are many types of RAID, such as mirroring (the process of using two drives to hold the same data, which is good for safety, because if one drive dies, the other still has all of the data) or striping (making two drives act as one drive by spreading data across them, which is good for speed). RAID is a very cool but complex topic that'll be discussed in detail later on.
Case Fan Support
Every motherboard has a CPU fan power connector, usually a four-wire connector that supports three-wires fans too. Some motherboards offer one or more fan power connectors for case fans. These are almost always only three-wire connectors. The case fans plugged into the motherboard can be monitored and controlled in Windows, unlike case fans connected only to the power supply, so they add a nice feature.
Expansion Bus
Expansion slots have been parts of the PC from the very beginning. Way back then, IBM created the PC with an eye to the future; the original IBM PC had slots built into the motherboard--called expansion slots--for adding expantion cards and thus new functions to the PC. The slots and accompanying wires and support chips on the first PC and on the latest and greatest PC are called the expansion bus.
Structure and Function of the Expansion Bus
As you've learned, every device in the computer--whether soldered to the motherboard or snapped into a socket--connects to the external data bus and the address bus. The expansion slots are no exception. They connect to the rest of the PC through the chipset. Exactly where on the chipset varies depending on the system. On newer systems, the expansion slots connect to the CPU because modern CPUs contain a lot of controller features that used to be in the chipset. In older systems, the expansion slots connect directly to the chipset. Finally, many systems have more than one type of expansion bus, with slots of one type connecting to the CPU and slots of another type connecting to the chipset.
The chipsets provides an extension of the address bus and data bus to the expansion slots, and thus to any expansion cards in thsoe slots. If you plug a hard drive controller card into an expansion slot, it functions just as if it were built into the motherboard, albeit with one big difference: speed. The system crystal provides a critical function for the entire PC, acting like a drill sergeant calling a cadence, setting the pace of activity in the computer. Every device soldered to the motherboard is designed to run at the speed of the system crystal. A 200-MHz motherboard, for example, has its chipset chips all timed by a 200-MHz crystal.
Clock crystals aren't just for the CPUs and chipsets. Pretty much every chip in your computer has a CLK wire and needs to be pushed by a clock chip, including the chips on your expansion cards. Suppose you buy a device that did not come with your computer--say, a sound card. The chips on the sound card need to be pushed by a CLK signal from a crystal. If PCs were designed to use the system crystal to push that sound card, sound card manufacturers would need to make sound cards for every possible motherboard speed. You would have to buy a 100-MHz sound card for a 100-MHz system or a 200-MHz sound card for a 200-MHz system.
That would be ridiculous, and IBM knew it when they designed the PC. They had to make an extension to the external data bus that ran at its own standardized speed. You would use this part of the external data bus to snap new devices into the PC. IBM achieved this goal by adding a different crystal, called the expansion bus crystal, which controlled the part of the external data bus connected to the expansion slots.
The expansion slots run at a much slower speed than the frontside bus. The chipset acts as the divider between the two buses, compensating for the speed difference with wait states and special buffering (storage) areas. No matter how fast the motherboard runs, the expansion slots run at a standard speed. In the original IBM PC, that speed was about 14.318 MHz ÷ 2, or about 7.16 MHz. Luckily, modem expansion buses run much faster! Let's start with the oldest of the modem expansion slots, PCI.
PCI
Intel introduced the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus architecture in the early 1990s, and the PC expansion bus was never again the same. Intel made many smart moves with PCI, not the least of which was releasing PCI to the public domain to make PCI very attractive to manufacturers. PCI provided a wider, faster, more flexible alternative than any previous expansion bus. The exceptional technology of the new bus, combined with the lack of a price tag, made manufacturers quickly drop older buses and adopt PCI.
PCI really shook up the PC world with its capabilities. The original PCI bus was 32 bits wide and ran at 33 MHz, which was superb, but these features were expected and not earth-shattering. The coolness of PCI came from its capability to coexist with other expansion buses. When PCI first came out, you could buy a motherboard with both PCI and older slots. This was important because users could keep their old expansion cards and slowly migrate to PCI. Equally impressive was that PCI devices were (and still are) self-configuring, a feature that led to the industry standard that became known as plug and play (PnP). Finally, PCI had a powerful burst-mode feature that enabled very efficient data transfers.
Mini-PCI
PCI made it into laptops in the specialty Mini-PCI format. Mini-PCI was designed to use low power and to lie flat--both good features for a laptop expansion slot. Mini-PCI, like full-sized PCI, is only on older computers.
PCI Express
PCI Express (PCIe) is still PCI, but it uses a point-to-point serial connection instead of PCI's shared parallel communication. Consider a single 32-bit chunk of data moving from a device to the CPU. In PCI parallel communication, 32 wires each carry one bit of that chunk of data. In serial communication, only one wire carries those 32 bits. You'd think that 32 wires are better than one, correct?
First of all, PCIe doesn't share the bus. A PCIe device has its own direct connection (a point-to-point connection) to the CPU, so it does not wait for other devices. Plus, when you start going really fast (think gigabits per second), getting all 32 bits of data to go from one device to another at the same time is difficult, because some bits get there slightly faster than others. That means you need some serious, high-speed checking of the data when it arrives to verify that it's all there and in good shape. Serial data doesn't have this problem, as all of the bits arrive one after the other in a single stream. When data is really going fast, a single point-to-point serial connection is faster than a shared 32-wire parallel connection.
And boy howdy, is PCIe ever fast! A PCIe connection uses one wire for sending and one for receiving. Each of these pairs of wires between a PCIe controller and a device is called a lane. Each direction of a lane runs at 2.5 gigatransfers per second (GTps) with PCIe 1.x, 5 GTps with PCIe 2.x, 8 GTps with PCIe 3.x, and a whopping 16 GTps with PCle 4.0! Better yet, each point-to-point connection can use 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 lanes to achieve a maximum theoretical bandwidth of up to 256 GTps. The transfer rate describes the number of operations happening per second. With serial communication, you almost get a one-to-one correlation between transfer rate and binary data rate. The effective data rate drops a little bit because of the encoding scheme--the way the data is broken down and reassembled--but full-duplex data throughput can go up to a whopping 32 GBps on a x16 connection.
EXAM TIP
You need to know the various motherboard expansion slots for the CompTIA 220-1001 exam, especially PCI and PCIe.
The most common PCIe slot is the 16-lane (x16) version most often used for video cards. The first versions of PCle motherboards used a combination of a single PCle x16 slot and a number of standard PCI slots. (Remember, PCI is designed to work with other expansion slots, even other types of PCI.) There is also a popular small form factor version of PCI Express for laptop computers called PCI Express Mini Card, or Mini-PCIe, which in future topic "Portable Computing" will covers in detail.
The bandwidth generatred by a x16 slot is far more than anything other than a video card would used, so most PCIe motherboards also contain slots with fewer lanes. Currently x1 is the most common general-purpose PCIe slot. You'll also see x4 slots motherboards.
NOTE
When you talk about the lanes, such as x1 or x16, use "by" rather than "ex" for the multiplication mark. So "by 1" and "by 16" are the correct pronunciations.
Try This! Shopping Trip
So, what's the latest PCIe motherboard out there? Get online or go to your local computer store and research higher-end motherboards. What combinations of PCIe slots can you find on a single motherboard? Which motherboard has the most x16 lanes? Why? Jot them down and compare your findings with your classmates' findings.
Installing Expansion Cards
Installing an expansion card successfully--another one of those bread-and-butter tasks for the PC tech--requires at least four steps. First, you need to know that the card works with your system and your operating system. Second, you have to insert the card in an expansion slot properly and without damaging the card or the motherboard. Third, you need to provide drivers for the operating system--proper drivers for the specific OS. Fourth, you should always verify that the card functions properly before you walk away from the PC.
EXAM TIP
The four steps involved in instaling expansion cards apply to all types of expansion cards. The CompTIA A+ exams will ask you about cards ranging from common--sound, video, and networking--to other specific cards for USB, Thunderbold, and modern connections. They'll ask about wireless and cellular networking cards, storage cards, TV tuner cards, video capture cards, riser cards, and more, all of which we'll cover in their proper topics. You install any of them using the same four steps:: knowledge, physical installation, device drivers, and verification.
Step 1: Knowledge
Learn about the device you plan to install--preferrably before you purchase it! Does the device work with your system and operating system? If you use a recent version of Windows, the answer to these questions is almost always "yes". If you're attempting to install an old device or if you're trying to install a very unique device in a less-common operating system such as Linux, these questions become important. A lot of older hardware simply won't work with new versions of Windows, especially Windows 10. Check the device's documentation and check the device manufacturer's Web site to verify that you have the correct drivers. While you're checking, make sure you have the latest version of the driver; most devices get driver updates more oten than the weather changes in Texas.
Step 2: Physical Installation
To install an expansion card successfully, you need to take steps to avoid damaging cards, the motherboard, or both. This means knowing how to handle a card and avoiding electrostatic discharge (ESD) or any other electrical issue. You also need to place the card firmly and completely into an available expansion slot.
