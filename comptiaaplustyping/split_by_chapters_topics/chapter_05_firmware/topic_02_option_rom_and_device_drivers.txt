Option ROM and Device Drivers
Every piece of hardware in your computer needs some kind of programming that tells the CPU how to talk to that device. When IBM invented the PC decades ago, they couldn't possibly have included all of the necessary BIOS routines for every conceivable piece of hardware on the system ROM chip. How could they? Most of the devices in use today didn't exist on the first PCs. When programmers wrote the first BIOS, for example, network cards, mice, and sound cards did not exist. Early PC designers at IBM understood that they could not anticipate every new type of hardware, so they gave us a few ways to add programming other than on the BIOS. I call this BYOB--Bring Your Own BIOS. You can BYOB in two ways: option ROM and device drivers. Let's look at both.
Option ROM
The first way to BYOB is to put the BIOS on the hardware device itself. A serial ATA RAID hard drive controller is basically just a card that lets you add more hard drives to a PC. The chip in the center of it with the wires coming out of the sides is a flash ROM that stores BIOS for the card. The system BIOS does not have a clue about how to talk to this card, but that's okay, because this card brings its own BIOS on what's called an option ROM chip.
More BIOS that come on option ROMs tell you that the exist by displaying information when you boot the system. Shown below is a typical example of an option ROM advertising itself.

In the early days of the PC, you could find all sorts of devices with BIOS on option ROMs. Today, option ROMs have mostly been replaced by more flexible software methods (more on device driver sofware in the next section), with one major exception: video cards. Every video card made today contains its own BIOS. Option ROM work well but are hard to upgrade. For this reason, most hardware relies on software BYOB.
Device Drivers
A device driver is a file stored on the PC's hard drive that contains all of the commands necessary to talk to whatever device it was written to support. All operating systems employ a method of loading these device drivers into RAM every time the system boots. They know which device drivers to install by reading a file (or files) that lists which device drivers the system needs to load at boot time. All operating systems are designed to look at this list early on in the boot process and copy the listed files into RAM, thereby giving the CPU (and the OS) the capability to communicate with the hardware supported by the device driver.
Device drivers come with the device when you buy it. When you buy almost any device for your computer, that new sound card or monitor or whatever usually comes with some kind of media, often an optical disc, that holds all of the necessary device drivers (and usually a bunch of extra goodies).
In manay cases you may not want to use installation media and just let the OS handle things. All operating systems use online tools to detect and automatically install device drivers. You might want to add or remove device drivers manually at times. Windows stores drivers (and a lot more) in a database called the Registry, which we'll talk about in detail in future topic "Windows Under the Hood". Techs rarely deal directly with the registry, but rather instead indirectly through the Device Manager utility.
BIOS, BIOS Everywhere!
As you should now understand, every piece of hardware on a system must have an accompanying program that provides the CPU with the code necessary to communicate with that particular device. This code may reside on the system ROM on the motherboard, on ROM on a card, or in a device driver files on the hard drive loaded into RAM at boot. BIOS is everywhere on your system, and you need to deal with it occasionally.
