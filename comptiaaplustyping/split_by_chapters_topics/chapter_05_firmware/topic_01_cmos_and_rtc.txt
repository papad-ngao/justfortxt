- Maintain BIOS and CMOS properly
In CPUs, the address bus and data bus connect RAM to the CPU via the memory controller to run programs and transfer data. Assuming you apply power in the right places, you don't need anything else to make a simple computer. The only problem with such a simple computer is that it would bore you to death--there's no way to do anything with it! A PC needs devices such as keyboards and mice to provide input, and output devices such as monitors and speakers to communicate the current state of the running programs to you. A computer also needs permanent storage devices, such as solid-state devices, to store programs and data when you turn off the computer.
This chapter discusses in detail the software that controls a PC at its core. We'll start with a couple of sections on why and how it all works, and then we'll look at hardware and self-testing circuits. The chapter finishes with the finer points of maintaining this essential programming and hardware.
*1001*
We Need to Talk
For a keyboard or a monitor or a hard drive to work with a CPU, they must communicate via some kind of physical connection. More than that, these peripherals (usually) can't connect directly to the CPU. This communication requires a controller, a chip that connects the device to the CPU.
Getting a CPU to communicate with a controller starts with some kind of interconnection--a communication bus (that means wires) that enables the CPU to send commands to and from devices. To make this connection, let's extend the data bus and the address bus throughout the motherboard, connecting all of the computer's controllers to the CPU.
Early motherboards were covered in controller chips, A very early motherboard could be absolutely covered in controller chips (as well as many other chips).
Over time, chip manufacturers began to combine multiple controllers into specifically designed chipsets. Early chipsets such as the Intel 430VX consisted of two paired chips called the north bridge and southbridge.
Chipsets were in parts for many years, roughly from 1900 to around 2010. Today's CPUs have controllers built in, such as the memory and display controllers. Almost all chipsets are now a single chip--Intel's name for this chip is Platform Controller Hub (PCH). A motherboard could have the CPU hiding underneath giant fans, and the PCH underneath heat sink. AMD (and most of the tech industry) refers to the chip as the chipset.
NOTE
All but the lowest-powered chipsets require cooling fins or fans. Also, even though chipsets are often single-chip solutions, it's common tech speak to say "chipset" (even though "set" implies more than one chip).
The chipset extends the data bus to every device on the PC. The CPU uses the data bus to move data to and from all the devices of the PC. Data constantly  flows on the data bus among the CPU, chipset, RAM, and the other devices on the PC.
It's not too hard to swallow the concept that the CPU uses the address bus to talk to the devices, but how does it know what to say to them? How does it know all of the patterns of ones and zeros to place on the address bus to tell the hard drive it needs to send a file? Let's look at the interaction between the keyboard and CPU for insight into this process.
Talking to the Keyboard
The keyboard provides a great example of how the buses and support programming help the CPU get the job done. In early computers, the keyboard connected to the data bus via a special chip known as the keyboard controller. Don't bother looking for this chip on your motherboard--the chipset handles keyboard controller functions. The way the keyboard controller--or technically, the keyboard controller circuitry--works with the CPU, however, has changed only a small amount in the past decades, making it a perfect tool to illustrate how the CPU talks to a device.
NOTE
Techs commonly talk about various functions of the chipset as if those functions were still handled by discrete chips. You'll hear about memory controllers, keyboard controllers, mouse controllers, USB controllers, and so on, even though they're all just circuits on the CPU or chipset.
The keyboard controller was one of the last single-function chips to be absorbed into the chipset.
Every time you press a key on your keyboard, a scanning chip in the keyboard notices which key you pressed. Then the scanner sends a coded pattern of zeros and ones--called the scan code--to the keyboard controller. Every key on your keyboard has a unique scan code. The keyboard controller stores the scan code in its own register. Does it surprise you that the lowly keyboard controller has a register similar to the CPU? Lots of chips have registers--not just the CPUs.
How does the CPU get the scan code out of the keyboard controller? While we're at it, how does the CPU tell the keyboard to change the typematic buffer rate (when you hold down a key and the letter repeats) or to turn the number lock LED on and off, to mention just a few other jobs the keyboard needs to do for the system? The point is that the keyboard controller must be able to respond to multiple commands, not just one.
The keyboard controller accepts commands exactly as you saw the CPU accept commands. Remember when you added 2 to 3 with the 8088? You had to use the specific commands from 8088's codebook to tell the CPU to do the addition and then place the answer on the external data bus. The keyboard controller has its own codebook--much simpler than any CPU's codebook, but conceptually the same. If the CPU wants to know what key was last pressed on the keyboard, the CPU needs to know the command (or series of commands) that orders the keyboard controller to put the scan code of the letter on the external data bus so the CPU can read it.
BIOS
The CPU doesn't magically or otherwise automatically know how to talk with any device; it needs some sort of support prrogramming loaded into memory that teaches it about a particular device. This prorgramming is called basic input/output services (BIOS). The programs dedicated to enabling the CPU to communicate with devices are called services (or device drivers, as you'll see later in the chapter). This goes well beyond the keyboard, by the way. In fact, every device on the computer needs BIOS! But let's continue with the keyboard for now.
Bringing BIOS to the PC
A talented programmer could write BIOS for a keyboard if the programmer knew the keyboard's codebook; keyboard are prettty simple devices. This begs the question: Where would this support programming be stored? Programming could be incorporated into the operating system. Storing programming to talk to the hardware of your PC in the operating system is great--all operating systems have built-in code that knows how to talk to your keyboard, your mouse, and just about every piece of hardware you may put into your PC.
That's fine once the operating system's up and running, but what about a brand-new stack of parts you're about to assemble into a new PC? When a new system is being built, it has no operating system. The CPU must have access to BIOS for the most important hardware on your PC: not only the keyboard, but also the monitor, mass storage drives, optical drives, USB ports, and RAM. This code can't be stored on a hard drive or optical disc--these important devices need to be ready at any time the CPU calls them, even before instaling a mass storage device or an operating system.
The perfect place to store the support programming is on the motherboard. That settles one issue, but another looms: What storage medium should the motherboard use? DRAM won't work, because all of the data would be erased every time you turned off the computer. You need some type of permanent program storage device that does not depend on other peripherals to work. And you need that storage device to sit on the motherboard.
ROM
Motherboards store the keyboard controller support programming, among other programs, on a special type of device called a read-only memory (ROM) chip. A ROM chip stores programs, services, exactly like RAM. ROM differs from RAM in two important ways. First, ROM chips are nonvolatile, meaning that the information stored on ROM isn't erased when the computer is turned off. Second, traditional ROM chips are read-only, meaning that once you store a program on one, you can't change it. Motherboards use a type of ROM called flash ROM, the same stuff that stores your data in your smartphone or SSD. That is why we call updating the BIOS firmware. "flashing the BIOS", which we will cover later in this chapter.
Every motherboard has a flash ROM chip, called the system ROM chip because it contains code that enables your CPU to talk to the basic hardware of your PC. As alluded to earlier, the system ROM holds BIOS for more than just the keyboard controller. It also stores programs for communicating with hard drives, optical drives, display devices, USB ports, and other basic devices on your motherboard.
To talk to all of the hardware requires hundreds of little services (2 to 30 lines of code each). These hundreds of little programs stored on the system ROM chip on the motherboard are called, collectively, the system BIOS. Techs call programs stored on ROM chips of any sort firmware. You will commonly hear techs today refer to the system firmware--what CompTIA (and this book) calls system BIOS.
EXAM TIP
Programs stored on ROM chips--flash or any other kind of ROM chip--are known collectively as firmware, as opposed to programs stored on dynamic media, which are collectively called software.
System BIOS support
Every system BIOS has two types of hardware to support. First, the system BIOS supports all of the hardware that never changes, such as the keyboard.
Another example of hardware that never changes is the PC speaker (the tiny one that beeps at you, not the ones that play music). The system ROM chip stores the BIOS for these and other devices that never change.
Second, the system BIOS supports all of the hardware that might change from time to time. This includes RAM (you can add RAM) and hard drives (you can replace your hard disk drive [HDD] with a larger drive or a solid-state drive [SDD] or add a second drive of either type). The system ROM chip stores the BIOS for these devices, but the system needs another place to store information about the specific details of a piece of hardware. This enables the system to differentiate between a Western Digital Blue 4-TB HDD and a Samsung 860 EVO 2-TB SSD, and yet still support both drives right out of the box.
UEFI
Modern systems use firmware programming called the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Here are a few advantages of UEFI over the original BIOS in PCs:
- UEFI supports booting to partitions larger than 2.2 TB.
- UEFI firmware is native 32- or 64-bit; this lets the manufacturers include lots of features for setup and diagnoses.
- UEFI handles all boot-loading duties; no more jumping from boot sector to boot sector.
- UEFI is portable to other chip types, not just 16-bit x86.
All current systems uses UEFI. Many also provide legacy support for BIOS services in case you feel some retro gaming is in order But a zillion older systems use the older BIOS. Most techs continue to call the support software BIOS, even though technically the terms differ. There's no standardization on how to pronounce UEFI, by the way. Microsoft initializes it: "U-E-F-I". Other say "you-fee" or "you-fie". For a job interview, stick with initializing it. You can't go wrong that way.
CMOS and RTC
Because the BIOS firmware is stored in ROM, and ROM is read only, it needs a place to store all its settings so they don't have to be re-entered every time you boot your computer. That place is a tiny bit of RAM hooked up to a small battery to keep it working with the PC off. We call this memory the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip. In addition to storing all the various BIOS settings, the CMOS also handles the system's real-time clock (RTC) so you don't have to keep setting the time on every boot.
The standalone CMOS chip has long since been incorporated into the main chipset. The information stored in CMOS is necessary for the PC to function.
If the data stored in CMOS about a piece of hardware (or about its fancier features) is different from the specs of the actual hardware, the compuer cannot access that piece of hardware (or use its fancier features). It is crucial that this information be correct. If you change any of the previously mentioned hardware, you must update CMOS to reflect those changes. You need to know, therfore, how to change the data in CMOS.
EXAM TIP
All the details of UEFI and CMOS that you're going to spend many hours memorizing for the 1001 exam only apply to PCs and Linux machines. Apple computers have EFI and CMOS, but Apple designs their systems from the ground up as unified systems. Apple has done all the work for you and you simply use the MacOS machine.
Every PC ships with a program built into the system ROM called the system setup utility that enables you to access and modify CMOS data. On a completely new system, with no operating system installed, you'll see some information like as the detail shown below. After the OS is installed, these screens effectively disappear. I'll show you how to access them in a little bit.
Some detail from Gigabyte system setup utility:
> M.I.T. Current Status (Show all information about M.I.T. status)
- BIOS Version: F2
- BCLK: 99.97MHz
- CPU Frequency: 3601.11MHz
- Memory Frequency: 2132.82MHz
- Total Memory Size: 32768MB
- CUP Temperature: 38.0 degree C
- Vcore: 1.116V
NOTE
The terms CMOS setup program, CMOS, and system setup utility are functionally interchangeable today. You'll even hear the program referred to as the BIOS setup utility. UEFI/BIOS setup, or UEFI firmware settings.
Typical System Setup Utility
Every BIOS/UEFI maker's system setup utility looks a little different, but don't let that confuse you. They all contain basically the same settings; you just have to be comfortable poking around the different interfaces. To avoid doing something foolish, do not save anything unless you are sure you have it set correctly.
Several years ago, BIOS/UEFI manufacturers in the computer space migrated to graphical system setup utilities that enable you to use a mouse. You'll find plenty of examples in the field of the classic text-only system setup utilities. You need to know both, so this section will show you both styles. We'll run through a graphical version first, then skim through an older text-only version.
Graphical UEFI System setup utility
A typical, simple graphical setup screen for system setup utility has two modes: EZ and advanced. You can't do much in the first EZ Mode screen except view information about installed components, select one of three preset System Performance optimization options, and change the boot priority.

Click the option to go in Advanced Mode and you'll get a much more versatile utility for changing the interface configurations. The Main tab offers some BIOS component information, such as surface details on amount of RAM and speed of CPU, plus a couple of options to modify the language and date and time. (Some utilities will show information about installed hard drives and optical drives; this UEFI firmware presents that information elsewhere).
Some detail from ASUS UEFI system setup utility in Main tab:

        - +5V: 5.014 V
        - +3.3V: 3.335 V

The Main tab also enables you to configure modest BIOS security by setting an administrator or user password. (The default for the above UEFI BIOS is Access Level: Administrator. Click the Security option to change access information. UEFI setup screens differ somewhat, but you'll find similar options in all of them).
An administrator password locks or unlocks access to the system setup utility. A user password locks or unlocks the computer booting to an operating system. Set a BIOS/UEFI password when you encounter a scenario like installing computer kiosks at a convention or installing systems in a public library. A BIOS/UEFI password stops casual miscreants from messing with your accessible systems.
Things get far more interesting in the other tabs. Selecting the Ai Tweaker tab, for example, enables you to delve into the Dark Arts of overclocking both the CPU and RAM. You can change the clock multiplier, clock speeds, voltages, and more here. This is a great place to go fry a new CPU!
Some detail from ASUS UEFI system setup utility in Ai Tweaker tab:

...

NOTE
Some systems refer to the Monitor display as PC Health.
The Boot tab enables you to adjust boot settings. You can select devices to boot by priority, setting the boot sequence used by the motherboard. (See the "Boot Process" later in this chapter for more information). You can determine how the system will react/inform if booting fails, and more.

Text-Based UEFI Intel-Based Setup Utility
In this second walkthrough, we'll switch to a UEFI motherboard on Intel-based portable computer. As we go through the screens, pay attention to the option listed on each. I'll call out features that the graphical AMD-based UEFI didn't have.
The Information tab offers straightforward information about the CPU and RAM amount, and cryptic information about the hard drive. Other tabs do more.
Some detail from the Information tab of Text-Based UEFI on Lenovo IdeaPad Y410P:
(InsydeH20 Setup Utility, Rev. 3.7) [selected tab: "Information"]
- Product Name: Lenovo IdeaPad Y410P
- BIOS Version: 74CN44WW (V3.05)
- EC Version: 74CN44WW (V3.05)

The Configuration tab shows a number of built-in devices that you configure or enable/disable here. Because this is a portable, it has an option to turn on/off wireless networking capabilities.
Some available configuration options from the Configuration tab of Text-Based UEFI on Lenovo IdeaPad Y410P:
(InsydeH20 Setup Utility, Rev. 3.7) [selected tab: "Configuration"]
- System Time: "[12:23:19]"
    - hint (labeled as "Item Specific Help"):
        - Hour: Valid range is from 0 to 23.
        - Minute: Vali range is from 0 to 59.
        - Second: Vali range is from 0 to 59.
        - Increase/Reduce: F6/F5

- Deep S3 Function, selected: "[Disabled]"
- Graphic Device, selected: "[Discrete]"
There are two interesting options here that are covered in detail in other chapters but warrant a brief discussion now. The Intel Virtual Technology option enables or disables virtualization support for virtual machines.
A virtual machine is a powerful type of program that enables you to run a second (or third to fourth), software-based machine inside your physical PC. It re-creates the motherboard, hard drives, RAM, network adapters, and more, and is just as powerful as a real PC. To run these virtual machines, however, you'll need a very powerful PC--you are trying to run multiple PCs at the same time, after all.
To support this, CPU manufacturers have added hardware-assisted virtualization. Intel calls their version Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT for short), and AMD calls theirs AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) technology. This technology helps the virtual machines use your hardware more efficiently and is controlled by the BIOS. This feature is disabled by default in BIOS, so if your virtual machine requires hardware-assisted virtualiation, you'll need to enable it here.
NOTE
In future topic "Virtualization" will covers machines in gory detail. Stay tuned!
This particular laptop has built-in graphics courtesy of the Intel Core i7 processor, plus it has a dedicated add-on video card for gaming. The Graphic Device option, set here to Discrete, means to use the dedicated video card when possible. This uses more electricity than the graphics support using only the processor, but it makes for way possible gaming!
NOTE
In future topic "Display Technologies", goes into video options (and gaming) in modern systems.
The Security tab offers a lot more options for configuring BIOS security than found on the Main tab of the of the AMD-based system. You see the Administrator Password and Use Password options, but there's also an option to set a couple of different hard drive passwords.
Some available configuration options from the Security tab of Text-Based UEFI on Lenovo IdeaPad Y410P:
(InsydeH20 Setup Utility, Rev. 3.7) [selected tab: "Security"]
- Administrator Password, current value: "Not set"
- User Password, current value: "Not set"
- HDD Password, current value: "Not set"
> Set Administrator Password
    - hint (labeled as "Item Specific Help"):
        - Set or Change the Administrator Password. Passwords must be at least one character in length
        - Administrator Password must be set in order to set a Power on Password and User Password.
- Set Hard Disk Passwords
- Secure Boot, selected: "[Enabled]"
- Secure Boot Status: Enabled
- Platform Mode: User Mode
- Secure Boot Mode: Standard
- Reset to Setup Mode, selected: "[Enter]"
- Restore Factory Keys, selected: "[Enter]"

The Secure Boot feature you can see on the Security tab is a UEFI protocol that secures the boot process by requiring properly signed software. This includes boot software and software that supports specific, essential components. (See "Device Drivers" a littler later in this chapter.) Secure Boot requires an Intel CPU, a UEFI BIOS, and an operating system designed for it, such as Windows.
NOTE
Secure Boot is an example of a tool that uses drive encryption. Various types of encryption--essentially scrambling the information to make it inaccessible to bad guys--secure all sorts of processes and data in modern computing. In the future topic "Implementing Mass Storage" will discusses drive encryption specifically in more detail.
The Boot tab enables you to set boot options to determine which bootable device gets priority. Here is where you provide support for booting a USB device as well. It looks a little different from the graphical example presented earlier. See "The Boot Process" later in this chapter for more explanation.
Some available configuration options from the Boot tab of Text-Based UEFI on Lenovo IdeaPad Y410P:
(InsydeH20 Setup Utility, Rev. 3.7) [selected tab: "Boot"]
- Boot Mode, selected: "[UEFI]"
    - hint (labeled as "Item Specific Help"):
        - [UEFI]: For OS need pure UEFI.
        - [Legacy Support]: For OS need legacy support.
- USB Boot, selected: "[Enabled]"
- EFI:
    - Windows Boot Manager (ST1000LM024 HN-M101MBB)
    - EFI Network 0 for IPv4 (28-D2-44-34-16-48)
    - EFI Network 0 for IPv6 (28-D2-44-34-16-48)

Other BIOS Security Settings
Motherboard manufacturers, BIOS/UEFI writers, programmers, have implemented all kinds of security features over the years. This section mentions a couple you might run into on various motherboard (or on a certain exam in your near future).
Chassis Intrusion Detection/Notification
Many motherboards support the chassis intrusion detection/notification feature provided by the computer case, or chassis. Compabible cases contain a switch that trips when someone open the case. With motherboard support and a proper connection between the motherboard and the case, the CMOS logs whether the case has been opened and, if it has, posts a notification to the screen on the subsequent boot. How cool is that?
LoJack
Some PC manufacturers include LoJack security features in their firmware--this way, if your PC is stolen, you can track its location, install a keylogger, or even remotely shut down your computer.
Trusted Platform Module
The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) acts as a secure cryptoprocessor, which is to say that it is a hardware platform for the acceleration of cryptographic functions and the secure storage of associated information. The specification for the TPM is published by the Trusted Computing Group, an organization whose corporate members include Intel, Microsoft, AMD, IBM, Lenovo, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and many others.
The TPM can be a small circuit board plugged into the motherboard, or it can be built directly into the chipset. The CMOS setup program usually contains settings that can turn the TPM on or off and enable or disable it.
TPMs can be used in a wide array of cryptographic operations, but one of the most common uses of TPMs is a hard disk encryption. For example, the BitLocker Drive Encryption feature of Microsoft Windows can be accelerated by a TPM, which is more secure because the encryption key is stored in the tamper-resistant TPM hardware rather than on an external flash drive. Other possible uses of TPMs include digital rights management (DRM), network access control, application exection control, and password protection.
EXAM TIP
BIOS security-related options can include TPM, passwords, Secure Boot, intrusion detection/notification, and drive encryption.
Exiting and Saving Settings
Of course, all system utilities provide some method to Save, Exit Saving Changes, or Exit Discarding Changes. Use these as needed for your situation. Exit Discarding Changes is particularly nice for those folks who want to poke around the CMOS setup utility but don't want to mess anything up. Use it!

Some available configuration options from the Exit tab of Text-Based UEFI on Lenovo IdeaPad Y410P:
(InsydeH20 Setup Utility, Rev. 3.7) [selected tab: "Exit"]
> Exit Saving Changes
    - hint (labeled as "Item Specific Help"):
        - Exit Setup and save your changes.
- Exit Discarding Changes
- Discard Changes
- Save Changes
- Load Default Settings
- OS Optimized Defaults, current value: "[Win8 64bit]"

The CMOS setup utility would meet all the needs of a modern system for BIOS if manufacturers would just stop creating new devices. That's not going to happen, of course, so let's turn now to devices that need to have BIOS loaded from elsewhere.
NOTE
People serious about tweaking UEFI settings for maximum performance (overclocking) or minimum energy use (underclocking) can use a feature in some system setup utilities to save customized settings. Various utilities call them presets or profiles--essentially it's a "save these settings as" option. If something isn't quite right with the changes, go back into setup, make some changes, and try again. If you're fiddling for the day and want to play with a stable machine, pick the profile you created that is a stable machine. See "Care and Feeding of BIOS/UEFI and CMOS" later in this chapter for the ultimate undo features.
